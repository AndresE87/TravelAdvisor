### TripAdvisorBot

This Telegram bot helps you to choose destination for vacation. It predicts an average cost of the trip (tickets and the hotel) based on user's preferences.

Bot will asks you to type your origin point and destination point. Than it will offer you to choose the type of the flight and hotel you would prefer.

After that it parses prices from flight and hotel booking sites and predicts how much money you would have to spend on this trip in different months.

It can also suggest booking a hotel of a higher class if it would be just slightly more expensive, or, on the contrary, a lower class hotel, if it can save you a lot of money.
